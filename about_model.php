                <h1> About MobileNet_V2</h1>

                <P>
                    MobileNetV2 is a convolutional neural network architecture designed for mobile and embedded devices. It is a highly efficient and lightweight model that achieves impressive accuracy while keeping the computational requirements low. In this case, we will adapt MobileNetV2 to detect glaucoma using deep learning techniques.

Glaucoma is a chronic eye disease that leads to progressive damage of the optic nerve and can result in vision loss if left untreated. The development of an automated system that can detect glaucoma accurately and efficiently is of great importance for early diagnosis and intervention.

To train a MobileNetV2 model for glaucoma detection, we need a labeled dataset consisting of images of healthy and glaucomatous eyes. These images should cover a wide range of variations in terms of eye conditions, angles, and lighting conditions. The dataset should also be appropriately balanced to ensure the model learns effectively.
